Hello, future web creator! Ready to build your very first webpage? Let's do it together.

Step 1: Get the Code

First, you'll need the code for our webpage. You'll see a block of code below this guide. I want you to select all of it and copy it. Just highlight the text and press 'Ctrl+C' on Windows

Step 2: Paste into Notepad

Now, open a plain text editor. If you're on Windows, search for 'Notepad'. Once you have a blank document, paste the code you just copied. You can do this by pressing 'Ctrl+V' on Windows.

Step 3: Save as a Webpage

This is the most important step! Go to 'File' and then 'Save As'. In the 'File name' box, type myfirstpage.html. It's crucial that it ends with .html. For the 'Save as type' or 'Format', choose 'All Files'. Now, save the file to your desktop so you can find it easily.

Step 4: Open in Your Browser

Great! Now, go to your desktop and you should see a new file named myfirstpage.html with the icon of your web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge). Double-click on it, and... voilà! Your very own webpage will open in the browser.

Let's Have Some Fun!
Now that you've created the page, let's see what you can do with it. Open the myfirstpage.html file in your text editor again.

Changing Text: Look for the lines that start with <h1>, <h2>, or <p>. These are your text elements. Try changing the text that says "Welcome to My Awesome Page" or "[Your Name Here]" to your own words. Save the file and refresh your browser to see the changes instantly!

Changing Colors: See the line that says <body style="background-color:powderblue;">? That's what gives your page a light blue background. Try changing "powderblue" to "lightblue", "pink", or even a hex code like "#f2f2f2" for a light gray. You can also change the color of the text. Find style="color:blue;" and change "blue" to "green" or "purple".

Changing Alignment: Want to center your text? Look for style="text-align:center;". You can change "center" to "left" or "right" to align your text differently.

Adding Links: You can create links to any website. Find the line that says <a href="https://www.google.com">This is a link to Google</a>. Change the https://www.google.com to your favorite website's address, and change the text "This is a link to Google" to describe your link.

Adding Sound: You'll notice there's already a sound file on your page. The <audio> tag is what makes this possible. You can find different sound files online and replace the src (source) with a new link to add your own music or sound effects!

Your Turn to Create!
You've just learned the basics of HTML, the language of the web. You can now create and edit your own webpages. How cool is that?
